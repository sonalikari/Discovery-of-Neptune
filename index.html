     <h1><b>Discovering...Neptune...</b></h1> <p>NASA...</p> <br>27-09-2021 <br> Farthest Solar Planet - Neptune...<br> <br> The planet Neptune – now considered by most astronomers to be the outermost major planet in our solar system – was discovered on this date, using mathematics.<br> Johann Gottfried Galle, Urbain Jean Joseph Le Verrier, and John Couch Adams all worked independently to help discover this world in 1846. Their separate work to find Neptune led to an international dispute as to whom to attribute the discovery of the farthest planet of our solar system.<br> <br> 
    On the night 175 years ago on Sept. 23-24, 1846,at the Berlin Observatory, by astronomer Johann Gottfried Galle discovered Neptune, the eighth planet orbiting our Sun. The discovery was made based on mathematical calculations of its predicted position due to observed perturbations in the orbit of the planet Uranus. The discovery was made using a telescope since Neptune is too faint to be visible to the naked eye, and astronomers soon discovered a moon orbiting the planet. More than a century later, a second moon was discovered orbiting the planet. Our knowledge of distant Neptune greatly increased from the scientific observations made during Voyager 2's flyby in 1989, including the discovery of five additional moons and confirmation of dark rings orbiting the planet..<br> <br>This image of Neptune was taken by Voyager 2 less than five days before the probe's closest approach of the planet on Aug. 25, 1989, and shows the "Great Dark Spot" - a storm in Neptune's atmosphere - and the bright, light-blue smudge of clouds that accompanies the storm..<br><br> On September 23, 1846, Galle used Le Verrier’s calculations to find Neptune only 1° off Le Verrier’s predicted position. The planet was then located 12° off Adams’ prediction...<br>
